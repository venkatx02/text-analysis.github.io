title: "About Me"

Hello,

I'm Venkat, graduate student in the Data Analytics and Computational Social Science (DACSS) program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. With a bachelor's degree in computer science and almost-trivial experience in the corporate environment, my expertise lies in web application development and machine learning. Now, I have landed into computational social science which combines computer science and data science with social sciences. I always think about philosophical aspects in human behaviour. I love to deal with such questions in the areas of philosophy, political psychology and international affairs using modern computational approaches.
